## Automated Simulations with py2FEMM

This project is about automating the torque calculations and optimisation of an electric machine with the [py2FEMM](https://github.com/tamasorosz/py2femm) package and the [FEMM](https://www.femm.info/wiki/FAQ) solver. The project provided hands-on experience:
- in accessing a third-party software through Python;
- in automating calculations with numerous variables;
- in creating a user interface and handling the user inputs;
- in documenting a step-by-step user guide.

(Python: tkinter, pymoo, py2femm, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

# Web Application

## MaterialComparator

This project presents the development of a web-based Material Comparator application designed to compare material properties from the FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics) materials library, addressing the original FEMM tool's lack of side-by-side comparison functionality.

✅ Python Backend Development: Designed and implemented a Flask-based web application using Python 3.9, showcasing structured, clean, object-oriented programming principles.

✅ Object-Oriented Design: Applied Factory and Strategy design patterns, ensuring flexible, maintainable, and extendable code architecture.

✅ CI/CD Pipeline Integration: Configured TeamCity to automate lint checks, unit tests, and Docker builds, ensuring continuous integration and delivery aligned with best practices.

✅ Containerization with Docker: Dockerized the application for reliable local and cloud deployment, demonstrating readiness for a DevOps pipeline.

✅ Cloud Deployment: Deployed the containerised application to Google Cloud Run, enabling scalable, serverless operation with automated updates from the main GitHub branch.

✅ Frontend Integration: Created responsive HTML interfaces (index.html, comparison.html) connected with Flask routes to enable user-driven material property comparisons.

✅ Version Control & Release Management: Managed source code with Git and GitHub, using Poetry and pyproject.toml for structured dependency management and reproducible builds.

✅ Testing & Code Quality: Wrote comprehensive unit tests using unittest, applied linter checks (pylint, flake8, bandit) for code quality, and utilised automated testing in CI.

✅ Documentation & Project Management: Managed the project lifecycle using JIRA (Kanban, timelines, epics) and Confluence for documentation, demonstrating effective planning and execution.

✅ UML Design: Created UML diagrams (class and use-case) to communicate architecture and workflows clearly for documentation and stakeholder visibility.

✅ Agile Workflow & Time Management: Successfully scoped, planned, and completed the project in a three-day sprint, demonstrating strong time management and agile development skills.

✅ AI-Assisted Development: Leveraged ChatGPT and JetBrains AI Assistant for task support, enhancing productivity and workflow optimisation.

✅ Linux Familiarity: Utilised Linux environments for Docker containerization and testing pipelines, demonstrating OS versatility in development and deployment.

# Machine Learning

## Wine Quality Prediction

The project is about predicting the wine quality based on different chemical properties. I have implemented a Random Forest Classifier algorithm after
refining the initial data. The project provided hands-on experience:
- in sorting features based on linear correlation;
- in balancing the training set of the initial data with under- or oversampling;
- in interpreting the quality measures based on a test set;
- in documenting the conclusions I have drawn from the data analysis.

(Python: Scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)
