  I am a passionate researcher and simulation developer specialising in Python-based automation and robust design analysis methods for electric motor design.
  Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in robust design analysis and development. My daily work involves building and deploying Python-based simulation pipelines
  that accelerate innovation in the field of eMobility.  
  <br><br>
   I am currently working in the automotive industry at Robert Bosch Hungary, where I led a team of three in developing innovative electric motors to reduce
   dependence on permanent magnets in collaboration with academic partners. I have experience analysing drivetrain trends in electric vehicles, identifying
   market gaps and supporting drivetrain development.
