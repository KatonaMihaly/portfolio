## Wine Quality Prediction

The project is about predicting the wine quality based on different chemical properties. I have implemented a Random Forest Classifier algorithm after
refining the initial data. The project provided hands-on experience:
- in sorting features based on linear correlation;
- in balancing the training set of the initial data with under- or oversampling;
- in interpreting the quality measures based on a test set;
- in documenting the conclusions I have drawn from the data analysis.

(Python: Scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)
