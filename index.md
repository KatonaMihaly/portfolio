## Automated Simulations with py2FEMM

This project is about automating the torque calculations and optimisation of an electric machine with the [py2FEMM](https://github.com/tamasorosz/py2femm) package and the [FEMM](https://www.femm.info/wiki/FAQ) solver. The project provided hands-on experience:
- in accessing a third-party software through Python;
- in automating calculations with numerous variables;
- in creating a user interface and handling the user inputs;
- in documenting a step-by-step user guide.

(Python: tkinter, pymoo, py2femm, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

# Machine Learning

## Wine Quality Prediction

The project is about predicting the wine quality based on different chemical properties. I have implemented a Random Forest Classifier algorithm after
refining the initial data. The project provided hands-on experience:
- in sorting features based on linear correlation;
- in balancing the training set of the initial data with under- or oversampling;
- in interpreting the quality measures based on a test set;
- in documenting the conclusions I have drawn from the data analysis.

(Python: Scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)
